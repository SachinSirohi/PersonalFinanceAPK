## Executive Summary

This document outlines the business requirements for developing a local-first, offline-capable personal finance management application for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) managing investments and expenses across UAE and India jurisdictions. The application will serve as a comprehensive financial analysis tool, investment simulator, and expense tracker with advanced real estate portfolio management, goal-based financial planning, and multi-currency support.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Provide complete net worth visibility across geographies (UAE + India)
- Enable sophisticated real estate investment analysis with exit planning
- Track equity, mutual fund, and objective-based investments
- Automate expense monitoring through document import (PDF/Excel)
- Support inflation-adjusted goal planning for major life events
- Operate primarily offline with optional cloud backup/sync

---

## Business Context

### Target User Profile

**Primary User:** NRI professionals living in UAE (Dubai) with active financial interests in both UAE and India

**User Characteristics:**
- Tech-savvy with automation experience (n8n, APIs, development)
- Managing dual-country investments (UAE real estate, India mutual funds/stocks)
- Planning long-term family goals (children education, marriages, retirement)
- Privacy-conscious, preferring local data storage over cloud-mandatory solutions
- Currently using Excel for financial tracking and projections[file:1]

### Business Problem Statement

Current solutions have critical limitations:
1. **Fragmented tools:** Users must use separate apps for expenses, investments, real estate, and goal planning
2. **No NRI-specific features:** Most apps don't handle dual-country portfolios with different tax regimes, currencies, and regulations
3. **Limited real estate analysis:** Existing apps lack sophisticated deal analysis, exit planning, and scenario simulation
4. **Privacy concerns:** Cloud-mandatory apps with bank-linking raise data sovereignty and security concerns
5. **Inflexible goal planning:** Generic goal trackers don't account for inflation variance by goal type or multi-asset allocation strategies

### Success Criteria

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Complete migration from Excel-based tracking within 30 days of MVP launch
- 100% of transactions imported successfully from PDF/Excel statements
- Real estate exit scenario analysis completed in < 2 minutes per property
- Goal planning projections generated in < 5 seconds with inflation adjustments
- Zero data breaches or unauthorized access incidents

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- User reports improved financial decision confidence
- Reduced time spent on manual financial tracking by 70%
- Increased visibility into cross-border investment performance
- Ability to simulate "what-if" scenarios for investment decisions

4. **Storage:** Limited to device storage capacity (no cloud-mandatory architecture)
5. **Single user:** No multi-user or household sharing in MVP
6. **Manual data entry:** User must import statements or enter transactions manually

### Assumptions
1. User has basic financial literacy (understands terms
